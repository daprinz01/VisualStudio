Documentation for GDG UNN SEARCH AND SORT app
This app was written to help hashcode contestants to handle the large data file that will be 
given during the event. The motivation to write the code was born from challege I and my team faced during the Hashcode 2016 Event.
We found it difficult to handle all the data and sort them appropriately which consumed a lot of our time and, consequently, couldn't come up with a solution for submission
before the time allowed for the event elapsed so I thought it will be nice to prepare the best we can before hand.
It is a simple app both in code and functionality and is made open source for further contibutions.

Description of functionality:
When a user wants to simply get a particular value from a large array, 
the user simply enters the index of the desired value in the "Enter value" textbox after choosing the file then clicks the "Find" button.
To choose the file, click the "Select file" button. The file path of the selected file is also shown to the right of the button.

If a user wishes to use manual inputs as the array the user can click the button-like "Enter Array Manually" checkBox to show the required controls for input
and click the "Done" button when input has finished.

The user can use the "Filter" section to manipulate the array. 
The "Find smallest value" checkBox gets the smallest value in the array and shows the index of the value in the "Enter index of array" textbox.
The "Find largest value" checkBox gets the largest value in the array and shows the index of the value in the "Enter index of array" textbox.

When in the manual input mode the user can click the "Use Input File Array" checkbox to switch focus to the selected input file and 
also click the "Use Manual Array" checkBox to change focus from the selected input file to the manual input.

The result is always displayed below the filters.


I hope this little app helps you in the Hashcode Event.
Suggestions and modifications are welcomed.
